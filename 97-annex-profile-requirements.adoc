== Annex A: Profile Requirements

_Requirements_ for this specification are organised as perr the classes within the GA Supermodel. See the https://surroundaustralia.github.io/ga-supermodel/supermodel.html[Supermodel main documentation] for more information.

=== A.1 Material Sample Class

`tern:MaterialSample`

The https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/tern-ontology[TERN Ontology] defines a `tern:MaterialSample` subclass of https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/[SOSA]'s `Sample` class which is used by GA for physical samples.
