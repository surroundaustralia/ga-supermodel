The procedure may be applied in-situ, remotely, or ex-situ with respect to the sampling location. The result of an observation is an estimate of the value of a property of some feature. Use of a common model allows observation data using different procedures to be combined unambiguously.

The observation itself is also a feature, since it has properties and identity.

Observation details are important for data discovery and for data quality estimation.

The observation could be considered to carry “property-level” instance metadata, which complements the dataset-level and feature-level metadata that have been conventionally considered (e.g. ISO 19115)."""^^xsd:string ;

The observed property shall be a phenomenon associated with the feature-of-interest.

An observed property may be, but need not be, modelled as a property (in the sense of the General Feature Model) in a formal application schema that defines the type of the feature-of-interest.

An instance of GF_PropertyType shall describe a property that is either assignable or observable (7.1.2), such as “temperature”, “height”, “colour”, “material”. A property type may be an operation or function such as a spatiotemporal coverage. Property-type definitions may be organized into a hierarchy or ontology and managed in a register and catalogued to support discovery functions. The observed property supports semantic or thematic classification of observations, which is useful for discovery and data fusion.

NOTE In general, the value of a specific observedProperty can be associated with different feature types in different observations, thus allowing the results of observations made in different projects or campaigns, and even from different disciplines, to be combined when required.
