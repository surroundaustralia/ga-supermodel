It is usually a real-world feature from an application domain (Figures 5 and 10).

EXAMPLE A profile typically samples a water- or atmospheric-column; a well samples the water in an aquifer; a tissue specimen samples a part of an organism.

NOTE: In this ontology sosa:isSampleOf is expecte to link Samples to other Samples which, relative to the domain are Features of Interested but may be defined only as Samples themselves. For direct links from a Sample to an onject only declared as a Feature of Interest, sosa:hasSampledFeature should be used."""@en ;
