== Model

This model, the actual GA Supermodel itself, is a profiling - specialised reusing - of multiple, well-known Semantic Web models. It is organised into a series of _Levels_ which serve different purposed. All elements of the model are only defined once and the various _Levels_ simply present views of the model at differnt levels of abstraction to serve their viarous intended purposes.

=== Level 0: Model Background

This view of the model is a backgrounding one which describes the underpinning model mecahnics that it uses. The object modelling used is based on the _Web Ontology Language_ <<OWL>> and its own underlying use of RDF & RDFS footnote:[RDF: https://www.w3.org/RDF/, RDFS: https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/. These references generally need not be followed as descriptions of the use of OWL will cover their relevant concepts.]. The _Provenance Ontology_ <<PROV>> is used to model real-world causal dependencies - provenance.

==== Diagram Key

The figure below is a key for the elements in all of the model diagrams in this document.

==== Object Modelling

The elements from the above subsection are shown in relation to one another in the figure below.

[id=fig-level0-owl]
.OWL objects and their relations
image::img/level0-owl.png[]

The elements shown above are identified with prefixed IRIs that correspond to entries in the <<#tbl-prefixes, Namespace Table>>. A short explanation of the diagram key elements is:

* `owl:Class` - represents any conceptual class of objects. Classes are expected to contain individuals - instances of the class - and the class, as a whole, may have realtions to other classes
* `owl:NamedIndividual` - an individual of an `owl:class`. For example, for the class _ships_, an individual might be _Titanic_
* `rdf:property` - a relationship between classes, individuals, or any objects and Literals
* `rdfs:subClassOf` -  an `rdf:property` indicating that the domain (from object) is a subclass of the range (to objects). An example is the class _student_ which is a subclass of _person_: all _students_ are clearly _persons_ but not _vice versa_
* `rdf:type` - the property that related an `owl:NamedIndividual` to the `owl:Class` that it's a member of
* `Literal` - a simple literal data property, e.g. the string "Nicholas", or the number 42. Specific literal types are usually indicated when used

The remaining diagrams in this document use extensions to this basic model, for example <<#fig-level0-prov, Figure 4>> uses colour-coded specialised forms of `owl:Class` (subclasses of it) and the relations in <<#fig-central-classes, Figure 6>> are specialised forms of `rdf:property`.

==== Provenance

General provenance/lineage information about anything - a rock sample, a dataset, a term in a vocabulary etc. - is described using the _Provenance Ontology_ <<PROV>> which views _everything_ in the world as being of one or more types in <<#fig-level0-prov, Figure 4>>.

[id=fig-level0-prov]
.PROV main classes and main relations
image::img/level0-prov.png[]

According to PROV, all things are either a:

* `prov:Entity` - a physical, digital, conceptual, or other kind of thing with some fixed aspects
* `prov:Agent` - something that bears some form of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for another agent's activity
* `prov:Activity` - something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or with entities

While not often in front of mind for objects in any Data Domain, provenance relations always apply, for example: a `sosa:Sample` within the _Sampling_ domain is a `prov:Entity` and will necissarily have been created via a `sosa:Sampling` which is a `prov:Activity`. Another example: an `sdo:Person` related to a `dcat:Dataset` via the property `dcterms:creator` in the _DataCataloging_ domain is a specialised form of a `prov:Agent` related to a `prov:Entity` via `prov:wasAttributedTo`.

=== Level 1: Data Domains

The top-level view of the GA supermodel that assumes Level 0 background mechanics shows a set of 5 <<#data-domain, Data Domains>> which are:

1. https://linked.data.gov.au/def/supermodel/data-domains/data-cataloguing[Data Cataloguing]
2. https://linked.data.gov.au/def/supermodel/data-domains/organisations-people[Organisations & People]
3. https://linked.data.gov.au/def/supermodel/data-domains/theming[Theming]
4. https://linked.data.gov.au/def/supermodel/data-domains/observation[Sampling & Observation]
5. https://linked.data.gov.au/def/supermodel/data-domains/spatiality[Spatiality]

These are shown in <<fig-top-level, Figure 2>> below.

[id=fig-top-level]
.Top-level view of the GA Supermodel showing Data Domains
image::img/data-domains.png[]

These Data Domains are defined formally in a simple SKOS vocabulary within this model's set of machine-readable resources. The vocabulary may be access ddirectly at https://linked.data.gov.au/def/supermodel/data-domains.

Elements at all other levels of detail in this model are classified according to these Data Domains by use of the `dcat:theme` property, for example, the class `sosa:Sample` is within the _Sampling_ Data Domain, so it is defined as follows:

```turtle
sosa:Sample
    a owl:Class ;
    dcat:theme super:sampling ;
    ...
.
```

NOTE: This supermodel's origins are in GA's geology and spatial data work and thus other areas of GA's responsibility may not be adequately provided for with the Data Domains. While these current Data Domains are at a concpetual level above particular science domains and shouldn't be extende to cater for science areas such as Offshore Petrolium Resources or responsibility areas such as Community Safety, it may still be necissary for these domains may be added to accomodate other GA work in some way. Extensions should occur as little as possible.

=== Level 2: Central Classes

The next level of detail after the Data Domains introduces the Central Classes. Here the most significant, general, class per Data Domain is indicated, along with the main relationships between each of them. <<fig-central-classes, Figure 3>> shows this.

[id=fig-central-classes]
.Next level view of the GA Supermodel showing Central Classes
image::img/central-classes.png[]

The Central Classes of each of the Data Domains are well-used classes from well-known models. For example, the Central Class of _Organisation & People_ is <<PROV>>'s `Agent` class which is one of the three main classes of thing in PROV and used every time PROV is used to represent causal agents. PROV is used extensively to indicate how things - data, resources, systems - come to be.

A list of the Data Domains' Central Classes, their definitions, as given by their defining systems, and their defining system are given in <<tbl-central-classes, Table 2>> below.

=== Level 3: Domain Main Classes

At this level, the main classes within each Data Domain are identified and related to one another. In each Data Domain there is a well-known model used for the majority of the classes and relations. These well-known models are indicated to ensure that they can be followed if extensions to this level's modelling need to be made.

==== Data Cataloguing

This subsection details the main elements of the Data Cataloguing Data Domain.

[id=fig-dd-data-cataloguing]
.Domain Main Classes for Data Cataloguing
image::img/dd-data-cataloguing.png[]

This Data Domain's main classes are essentially the DCAT2 data model <<DCAT>> with a slight profiling: `dcterms:hasPart` should be used to indicate elements within catalogues (e.g. `dcat:Dataset` and other things within a `dcat:Catalog`) rather than the specialised properties of `dcat:dataset` because GA expects to catalogue many types of things and the type of the thing should be given by the thing, not the catalogue property used to indicate it.

==== Organisations & People

This subsection details the main elements of the Organisations & People Data Domain.

[id=fig-dd-orgs-people]
.Domain Main Classes for Organisations & People
image::img/dd-orgs-people.png[]

This Data Domain's main classes are centered on <<PROV>>'s `prof:Agent` class but specific types of agent - _person_ & _organisation_ are defined using schema.org <<SDO>>, the general-purpose ontology provisioned by Google, Microsoft & Yahoo for the description of web page data.

schema.org objects and properties are also used to define agents in the VocPub profile <<VOCPUB>> and are understood by ontology documentation tools such as pyLODE footnote:[https://pypi.org/project/pyLODE/] which is used by GA.

==== Sampling

This subsection details the main elements of the Sampling Data Domain.

[id=fig-dd-sampling]
.Domain Main Classes for Sampling
image::img/dd-sampling.png[]

Most of this Data Domain's main classes are taken directly from the _Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator Ontology_ (SOSA) which is part of the _Semantic Sensor Networks Ontology_ <<SSN>> with only the `tern:Site` class taken from another model, the TERN Ontology  <<TERN>>, which is just a specialisation of SOSA anyway. The TERN Ontology is the domain model of the _Australian Biodiversity Information Standard_ (ABIS) <<ABIS>> with which GA sampling data is intended to be compatible.

In addition to samples & sampling, this domain can cater for general _observations_ of things, e.g., observations of:

* chemicals in rock samples, determined in a lab
* images of the earth
* classification of statigraphic unit

Where `sosa:Sampling` activities result in `sosa:Sample` objects, `sosa:Observation` activities result in `sosa:Result` objects. The observation/result pair is a more generic form of the sampling/sample pair.

SOSA also has a `sosa:Platform` class - something that hosts sensors and other equipment - so GA field sites that contain notes on equipment are a combination of a `tern:Site` and a `sosa:Platform`.

==== Spatiality

This subsection details the main elements of the Spatiality Data Domain.

[id=fig-dd-spatiality]
.Domain Main Classes for Spatiality
image::img/dd-spatiality.png[]

This Data Domain's main classes are taken directly from GeoSPARQL 1.1 <<GEO>> which is used extensively in GA already. GeoSPARQL's main purposes are to relate things (`geo:Feature`) to their spatial projections - their geometries - and to relate things to one another - topological relations between features, such as _within_, _touches_, _disjoint_ etc.

Particular datasets tend to implement specialised types of things (usually referred to as _Feature Types_) and sometimes specialised relations between things, e.g. special _hydrological catchment_ feature type might relate to another by being _upstream_ of it. This is as per modelling in the Geofabric footnote:[https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/geofabric].

==== Theming

This subsection details the main elements of the Theming Data Domain.

[id=fig-dd-theming]
.Domain Main Classes for Theming
image::img/dd-theming.png[]

This Data Domain's main classes are taken from <<SKOS>> and their expected/required properties and relations are formally defined in _VocPub_, a "vocabulary publication profile of SKOS" <<VOCPUB>>. VocPub just mandates certain vocabulary metadata and relations between elements in vocabularies. Conformance of vocabularies to VocPub is also easily testable using the profile's validator and online tooling that support it footnote:[The validator itself is online at https://w3id.org/profile/vocpub/validator and is pre-loaded into GA's vocabulary servers e.g. https://vocabs.ga.gov.au. It can also be selected for online validation use at https://rdftools.surroundaustralia.com].
